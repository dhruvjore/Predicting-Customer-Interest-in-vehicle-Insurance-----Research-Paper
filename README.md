# Predicting-Customer-Interest-in-vehicle-Insurance-----Research-Paper

ABSTRACT :This research paper aims to predict customer interest in purchasing vehicle insurance from a health insurance
company using data science techniques. The study uses data collected from health insurance holders of the company and
employs data processing, analysis, and visualization techniques to prepare the data for machine learning models. Three
models, namely logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and random forests were trained on the data, and their performance matrices
were compared to determine the best-performing model. The study concludes that the random forests model outperformed the
other two models in predicting customer interest in purchasing vehicle insurance. The results of this study have practical
implications for health insurance companies seeking to expand their service offerings to customers. The study contributes to
the growing field of data science in the insurance industry and highlights the potential benefits of using machine learning
models to predict customer interests. The results of this research can aid insurance companies in developing targeted
marketing strategies and improving customer satisfaction.

Data Collection:
Utilized data collected from health insurance holders of the company to understand customer behavior and preferences.

Data Processing, Analysis, and Visualization:
Employed comprehensive data processing techniques to clean, organize, and prepare the dataset for analysis.
Conducted in-depth analysis of the data using various statistical methods to identify patterns and trends.
Utilized visualization techniques to present key insights and enhance the interpretability of the dataset.

Machine Learning Model Training:
Implemented three distinct machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forests.
Trained these models on the prepared dataset to predict customer interest in purchasing vehicle insurance.

Performance Metrics Comparison:
Evaluated the performance of each model using relevant metrics to assess their predictive capabilities.
Conducted a comparative analysis of the models, focusing on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Model Selection:
Concluded the study by identifying the Random Forests model as the best-performing among the three models.
Supported the selection with evidence from the performance metrics comparison.

Practical Implications for Health Insurance Companies:
Highlighted the practical implications of the study for health insurance companies aiming to diversify their service offerings.
Emphasized the potential benefits of predicting customer interests to enhance targeted marketing strategies and improve overall customer satisfaction.
